                <b>Funeral</b><br />
                <br />There are sixteen sacraments in Hinduism from birth to
                death. In these, the last ie the sixteenth rites are the rites
                that take place after death, which include the last farewell of
                the person, cremation and rituals that bring peace to the soul.
                The last rites have been given a lot in the scriptures because
                by this a person gets the best place in the hereafter and in the
                next life birth and happiness in the best family. It has been
                told in the Garuda Purana that the soul of a person whose last
                rites is not performed, after death, wanders as a ghost and
                suffers various kinds of troubles. Death is not considered the
                end of life in Hinduism. Upon death, it is believed that this is
                the time when the soul leaves this body and again assumes a new
                form, or begins the journey to attain salvation. This is the
                reason behind cremating the dead body after the death of a
                person. After coming out of the dead body, the soul is given
                speed on the path of salvation. It is believed in the scriptures
                that until the last rites of the dead body are not performed, he
                does not attain salvation. Cremation is the last rites out of
                the sixteen rites to be performed according to the scriptures.
                This ritual is performed in two ways.<br />

                <br />1. When dead body is available. He should be lit on fire
                with complete law.<br />

                <br />2. When a person dies by starvation, by violent animal, by
                hanging, by venom, by fire, by suicide, by falling, by rope, by
                keeping in water, by snakebite, by lightning, by iron, by weapon
                If it is caused by touching the mouth of a poisonous dog, then
                it is called Durmaran. In all these situations, death is not
                considered normal and the effigy cremation method is used for
                cremation after death.<br />

                <br />Cremation does not happen after sunset Cremation is never
                done after sunset. If the death took place after sunset, then it
                can be burnt only in the morning of the next day. It is believed
                that by performing cremation after sunset, the soul of the
                deceased person has to suffer in the afterlife and there may be
                defects in any part of it in the next life.<br />

                <br />At the time of cremation, the body placed on the pyre is
                circumambulated by taking water in a pitcher with a hole and at
                the end it is thrown back and broken. This action is done to
                dislodge the soul of the dead person from his body. But a deep
                philosophical mystery is also hidden in this action. This means
                that life is like a pot with a hole in which the water of age
                keeps on dripping every moment and in the end the soul leaves
                everything and the life of the pot ends.<br />

                <br />Pind Daan is performed by the male relatives of the
                deceased person. At the time of cremation, the heads of the male
                relatives of the deceased are shaved. It is not only a means of
                expressing reverence to the dead person, it also means that the
                responsibility has now come on them.<br />

                <br />After Pind Daan and Shradh cremation, Pind Daan of a
                person is done for thirteen days. Due to this, the soul of the
                dead person gets peace and his disillusionment with the dead
                body and his own family is dissolved.<br />

                <br />After death, after the death of a person, after the death
                of a person, what rituals should be performed and what things
                should be taken care of? What are the facts, cause and effect
                hidden behind the actions to be taken? After how many days
                should the thirteenth be? Sanskars after death Whenever a person
                dies in the house, then according to Hindu belief, mainly four
                types of rituals are performed -<br />

                <br /><b>soon after death:</b><br />
              </p>

              <div>
                <ul class="ps-4">
                  <li>While lighting the pyre,</li>
                  <li>at the time of thirteenth and</li>
                  <li>
                    At the time of death anniversary (one year after death).
                  </li>
                  <li>If death is felt before</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <br />
              <br />If the time of death is first realized, then the person of
              imminent death should meditate on the Supreme Brahman by removing
              his mind from all external objects and family friends. It is said
              in the Gita- If a person can be absorbed in the meditation of God
              even at the time of death, then he attains the highest speed. At
              this time it is the duty of the relatives and companions to create
              a spiritual environment around the impending death. Those who want
              to donate – food donation, donation, Godan, Gayatri chanting
              should be done by the person's hand or on his behalf as far as
              possible.<br />
              <br />One should read the chapters of the Gita, if he cannot read
              it, then his relatives and friends should read it and recite it
              and if he does not know the verses of the Gita, then the Gita
              should be uttered in his ear.<br />
              <br />Ganga water should be given and Tulsi leaves should be fed,
              if not able to eat, then it should be kept in the mouth.<br />

              <br /><b>Day 1</b><br />
              <br />It is believed in Hinduism that after death, a person goes
              to heaven or leaves his body and enters another body (yoni). The
              first actions to be performed after death, first of all, the dead
              soul should be bathed with cow urine, cow dung and pilgrimage
              water, with Kush and Ganges water or by wiping the body with a wet
              cloth and purify it. If there is a time constraint, then give a
              torrent with the water of Kush. Wear a new dhoti or washed clean
              clothes. Grind the soil of basil root and sandalwood from its wood
              and apply it all over the body. After spreading barley and black
              sesame on the ground covered with cow dung, lay the kushs in the
              southeast and lay the dying person on the north or east side.
              Light a ghee lamp. A dying person should not sleep in the sky
              plane, on the top floor or on the cot etc. At the last moment, the
              poleless should be put to sleep only on the ground below. One
              should not cry even after forgetting the well-wishers of the dead
              soul, because crying on this occasion brings great agony to the
              creature. Crying brings out phlegm and tears, they are forced to
              drink that dead soul, because after death its freedom is taken
              away. Mucushashru badharvermuktam preto bhud.kte yatovashah. So na
              rodityam hi kriya karya: self-powerful. (Yajnavalkya Smriti,
              Pvt.1/11, C.P., Pretkhand 14/88) Gangajal and tulsi dal should be
              given in the mouth of the deceased. Shaligram water should also be
              poured in the mouth. Gold pieces should be kept in the 7 holes of
              the deceased soul. Due to this, other wandering spirits do not
              torture the dead soul. If there is no gold, then add two drops of
              ghee. Ten Mahadan, Ashta Mahadan and Panchadhenu should be donated
              at the last moment. If all these are not available, then according
              to your power, resolve the inactive matter for those things and
              give it to the brahmin. Panchadhenu frees the dead soul from many
              torments. Panchadhenu are as follows- Rindadhenu: The dead soul
              has borrowed someone's loan and has not repaid it, to get rid of
              it. Papapanodhenu: For the atonement of all sins. Ukranti Dhenu:
              For the removal of four great sins. Vaitarni Dhenu: To cross the
              river Vaitarni. Moksha Dhenu: For the removal of all faults and
              for salvation. While being taken to the crematorium, the dead body
              should be protected from the touch of Shudra, Sutika, Menstrual.
              (Dharma Sindhu - 2nd) If touched by mistake, then it should be
              purified with Kush and water. By using Darbha (Kush) in Shradh,
              the incomplete Shradh is also considered complete and the
              salvation of the soul is assured, because Darbha and Til have
              originated from the body of the Lord. “Vishnurdehasamudbhutaah
              kushah krishnasvilastatha. (Garuda Purana, Shradh Prakash) Gopi
              sandalwood and Gorochan have special glory in Shradh. Only white
              flowers should be used in Shradh, not red flowers. "Pushpani
              Varjiani i.e. Raktavarnani i.e. Ch". (Brahmand Purana, Shradh
              Prakash) Krishna sesame should be used in Shradh, because it was
              born from the sweat of Lord Narasimha, from which Prahlad's father
              also got salvation. Darbha Narasimha was born from the souls of
              the Lord. In God's work, Yagyopaveet should be Savya (right), in
              father's work should be Apasavya (left) and in the offerings of
              sages and sages, it should be like a garland around the neck. Use
              Gangajal and Tulsi Dal repeatedly in Shradh. In Shradh, the elder
              or younger son (larger for father and younger for mother) is made
              to perform rituals for the rituals. If the deceased does not have
              any son, then the daughter, son-in-law or even the wife can sit in
              action. The deceased is bathed with water by applying rosewood oil
              on the head of his relatives and relatives. At the time of
              exhaling: the son and the successor male sprinkle Gangodak. After
              the death, he should put the head of the deceased in his lap, put
              ghee in his mouth, nostrils, both eyes and ears, cover him in a
              cloth, scatter sesame seeds on the ground with kushas and lay his
              head towards the north. At this time, while meditating on all the
              pilgrimages, bathe the deceased with pure water. Then apply
              sandalwood-scent etc. on it and take bath in the mouth. Then after
              applying sandalwood-smell etc., put Panchratna, Gangajal, and
              Tulsi in the mouth and wrap it in a pure cloth (shroud) and tie it
              properly on the earth. The meaning is carried by shoulder to the
              crematorium.<br />
              <br />There is no repetition of the dead by burning fire with
              Tulsi wood. TulsiKashtha Dagdhasya Na Tasya iteration:. (Skanda
              Purana, Pujapra) The doer himself should prepare fire from a large
              pot of camphor or ghee, and should not take fire from anyone else.
              At the time of burning, first fire should be given towards the
              head. Head: place Pradapayet. (Varaha Purana) Before cremation,
              there is a law to head the dead body towards north or east. Vato
              neetva crematoriums sthapyeduramuravam. (Garuda Purana) If there
              is a death in the 5 constellations of Aquarius etc., then it is
              called Panchak Maran. Get dazzled by the constellations of
              Mrityasya Pancha. Putty method: If death has taken place before
              Panchak and burning is to be done in Panchak, then make
              arrangements for effigies - by doing this there is no need for
              peace. On the contrary, if death has occurred somewhere in Panchak
              and burning after Panchak, then do Shanti Karma. If death has also
              taken place in Panchak and burning is also in Panchak, then both
              the effigy of the effigy and Shanti should be done.<br />
              <br />For the welfare of the phantom, an unbroken lamp of sesame
              oil should be lit south-facing for 10 days.<br />
              <br />The main person (he is also called the Karta) after placing
              the meaning in the crematorium, after the body-bath: the son of
              the officer of cremation should take a bath and wear pure clothes
              (dhoti-angocha etc.) and go near the deceased. He makes three
              rounds of it and the pot of water (which is kept on the shoulder)
              is broken. Breaking the pitcher is an indication of the departure
              of life from the body. Only men keep the dead body in the pyre.
              Putting ghee on the wood of the pyre, the son (doer) gives fire
              with a long stick after making three rounds of the pyre.<br />
              <br />After burning half the pyre, the son breaks the head of the
              deceased with three blows. This action is called cranial action.
              There is a belief behind this that the son freed him from the debt
              of the father who had broken the celibacy by giving birth to the
              son.<br />
              <br />After that all are purified by burying the datun in the
              river's ghats and for the peace of the dead soul, water is given
              five times with til and barley in that buried datun. Then everyone
              comes home<br />
              <br />Where the deceased was kept for the last time, mourning is
              done by lighting a lamp and keeping his picture. Talks about the
              goodness of the dead soul.<br />
              <br />On the first day, after buying food or getting food items
              from a close relative, one should eat food with family. The rules
              of celibacy should be followed. One should sleep on the ground. No
              one should touch. Food should be prepared at one time before
              sunset. Food should be salt free. Food should be served in an
              earthen vessel or a plate. First, keeping food out of the house
              for the sake of the ghost, then you should eat it yourself. Do not
              salute or bless anyone. Do not worship gods.<br />

              non-satisfaction.<br />
              <br />After the end of the Pind Daan of Dashagatra, there is a law

              sisters. Glory of Tarpan Until all the ancestors are not worshiped
              in the Shradh, there is no salvation for the soul. Therefore, in
              the activities of 10, 11, 12, 13 etc., do tarpan according to the
              scriptures. On the banks of the river Janeu Dev, Rishi, according

              guardian, friend, servant etc. All these tarpans come under Pitru
              Tarpan. Before all names, offer prayers to the dead soul. Note-
              Wherever the ancestors move in the form, they get the material of
              enjoyment according to them due to the inspiration of Kaal. For
              example, if they become cows, they get good grass. (Garuda Purana
              Pre. B.) Narayan Bali Pretonopatisthit Tatsarvamantriksha
              Vinashyati. Narayanbal: Karyo Lokgarha Miya Khag. The Shradh
              performed for the sake of the dead soul without Narayan Bali gets
              destroyed in space, without getting it. Therefore, it is best to
              do the law of performing Shradh before Narayan Bali as per the
              need.<br />

              leads to the attainment of Pitrline. In Sapindikaran Shradh, it is
              necessary to combine the meanings of Father, Pitamah and
              Prapitamaha. In this Shradh, after worshiping Vishnu, do Kaal Kama
              etc., worship the ancestors with paan. Pick up the half-pot of the
              phantom's primordial in the hand and leave the sesame seeds,
              flowers, holy water, etc. in the phantom's half-pot. Do these
              deeds according to the scriptures. In Sapindkaran Shradh, first
              place a coconut-shaped body on the ground covered with cow dung by
              saying the name of the phantom. Then keep the round body for the
              sake of father, grandfather and great-grandfather respectively.
              (If directly take the descendant of mother-in-law) Take the name
              of God and pierce a large body with a gold or silver wire. Then
              worship all the bodies by combining them with father, grandfather
              and great-grandfather respectively. Keep one body as a witness for
              the purpose of time and work.<br />

              <br /><b>Day 12</b><br />
              <br />By performing Shradh of Dwadshah on the thirteenth, the
              phantom receives Pitruyoni. But by performing the Shradh of
              Trayodshah, all the errors of the previous Shradhs are removed and
              all the actions are completed and attained to Lord Narayana.
              Shradh of the thirteenth is very important.<br />
              <br /><b>Day 13</b><br />
              <br />It is believed that the soul of the deceased travels for
              twelve days and crosses various yonis to reach its destination
              (Prabhudham). That is why the legislation has been made to do
              13th. But in some places, due to lack of time and other reasons,
              it is also done on the 13th, third or 12th day, in which the
              deceased's favorite food items are prepared and Brahma Bhoj is
              organized and the peace of the deceased is prayed for by giving
              donations to the Brahmins and the poor are given the clothes of
              the deceased. etc. are donated. Rice water is offered to the
              deceased while donating Pind every month.<br />
              <br />This Shradh should be done only on the 13th day. In folk
              practice, this Shradh is performed on different days according to
              the characters. But according to Garuda Purana, the thirteenth
              should be done only on the thirteenth day. In this Shradh, worship
              the Anantadi Chaturdash deities in Kush Chat. Then worship
              Lalitadi 13 goddesses in a copper urn under water. Tie the urn
              with yarn. Then do thirteen tilaks of kumkum around the urn. After
              all these actions, after being apasav, worship the ancestors on
              the mat.<br />

              <br />turban rite<br />
              <br />In this custom, on the death of the eldest male of a family,
              a turban (also known as dastar) is ceremonially tied on the head
              of the next eldest living male. Since the turban is a symbol of
              respect in the society of this region, it is shown by this ritual
              that the responsibility of the family's honor and welfare is now
              on this man's shoulders. Or else it is organized on the
              thirteenth.<br />

              <br />in a month and a half<br />
              <br />Families sit together and eat food.<br />

              <br />in six months<br />
              <br />Families sit together and eat food.<br />

              <br />in twelve months<br />
              <br />After a year, the anniversary is celebrated, in which Brahma
              Bhoj is performed and Shradh is performed for the deceased so that
              the deceased always help the family by becoming a father. The main
              purpose of doing and doing all these actions is to bring peace to
              the soul of the deceased and forgive him for the wrong deeds done
              for himself because whenever a person does good or bad deeds, it
              has an effect on all the people of the family. Through this, every
              family is made aware of the knowledge of the cycle of life and the
              fruits of actions. No Manglik should be organized, festivals etc.
              should be done for a whole year so that the departed soul does not
              suffer.<br />

              <br />for peace of soul<br />
              <br />Father is always around you. After death, the separation
              between us and the dead soul occurs only on the physical level,
              not on the spiritual level. Those who die prematurely, their souls
              keep wandering till their fixed age.<br />
              <br />When our ancestors, ancestors do not get peace even after
              death and they keep wandering in this world, then we feel Pitra
              Dosh. It has been said in the scriptures that to avoid the ill
              effects of Pitra Dosh, the remedy for disturbed life is Shradh and
              various measures are taken to avoid it, which include Shradh,
              Tarpan and pilgrimage, etc. Those whose fulfillment gives freedom
              from Pitra Dosh.<br />
              <br />There are twelve types of Shradh. We can get the blessings
              and grace of the dead soul by donating Shanti-Tarpan. According to
              Garuda Purana, after being satisfied with Shradh Karma, ancestors
              give us life, son, fame, glory, prosperity. According to Skanda
              Purana, the fulfillment of ancestors in Shradh is done by Brahmins
              only. Leave the bodies of Shradh in cow, crow or fire or water. If
              there is Pitra Dosh, even the home and the deities do not work and
              the life of such a person becomes cursed and disturbed.<br />
              <br />The person who does not perform the annual Shradh of the
              parents, he gets a dire hell and he is born in the Venus vagina.
              It has been said in the scriptures that the person who has died in
              an accident, poison or weapon, his Shradh should be done on the
              day of Chaturdashi. Persons who do not know the date of death of
              their parents, such person should perform Shradh Karma on the new
              moon day of Shradh Paksha. On the day of Navami, one should
              perform Shradh for his dead mother, grandmother, great-grandmother
              etc.<br />
              <br />- Pandit Ashok Premi Bansariwala<br />
              <br />When the wishes of the dead souls are not fulfilled after
              death, then their soul shows indirect effect, due to which
              inauspicious events happen. This is called paternalism. Due to
              this defect, misfortune also increases. Pitra dosha is one such
              dosha which occurs mostly in the horoscope. Due to this type of
              defect, a person has to face many types of problems. People go to
              places like Haridwar and Nashik to get rid of Pitradoshas. Know
              some things related to Pitru Dosh-<br />

              <br />* After the death of a person, when the relatives do not
              fulfill his last wishes, then his dead soul keeps wandering on the
              earth.<br />

              <br />* When the unfinished work of the dead person is not
              completed, then his soul indirectly pressurizes the family to
              complete the tasks. Due to which many inauspicious events happen
              in the family. This is paternalism.<br />
              <br />
              <br />* To get rid of Pitra Dosh, do Pind Daan and Tarpan on
              Shradh Paksha and Amavasya of every month for the spiritual peace
              of the ancestors.<br />

              troubles. If they do not perform Shradh, they harm us. By doing
