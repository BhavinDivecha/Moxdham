                                <h4><center>What is the true meaning of burning up of bad psychic imprints?</center></h4><br>
Friends, in our Hindu religion, thousands of festivals, vratas, actions, karma kandau, fasting, unity, are taking place, we do a lot according to the way of society, but the true meaning behind all of them has been completely lost.<br>
This means that if we are fasting normally, one time to be hungry and the other time to fill our stomachs, that is how everything has come to be, farali roti, farali gota, farali samosa… whatever is to be eaten farali, oh brother this is not fasting.<br>
The meaning of fasting is given in our Puranas, what is called true fasting, but friends, we will talk about it later, but today I want to talk about the wrong rituals that take place after death.<br>
Yes friends, the rituals that take place after the death of a man are completely wrong. But the reason behind it is because people do not have true information, they do not have knowledge. Because the true saints who gave us that knowledge are no more.<br>
In earlier times saints used to discuss scriptures and give true knowledge to people, but this is no longer the case. But through the Gujarat page, we want to bring to you the knowledge of the scriptures, the true understanding of living life.<br>
Friends, let us know what is the correct way of performing rituals after death, what is the reason behind it and what mistakes we make.<br>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>First of all, when a man dies, before laying his body on the ground, cow dung is smeared, as stated in Shraddha Sutak, and Pancham Shruti, smearing two two yards around the body i.e. up to four feet. Should. Because after death, thousands of germs are released from the body, and the spread of cow dung stops them from spreading. But now only one lit of cow dung is done, that too should be done according to the scriptures.</li>
        <br><li>If the dead body is male then keep the head in north direction, if it is female then keep the head in south direction. The reason behind this is that the hair is more attracted to the woman from the south and the man from the north. So her body can be safe for a long time without getting dirty, but this action is meant to be done now, no one knows the reason behind this.</li>
        <br><li>A copper coin is placed on the tongue in the mouth of the third dead man. Comes back and the dead man is alive. But now any steel coin is put on the tongue just to fulfill the ritual.</li>
        <br><h4><center>What is the implication behind the rituals that are taking place?</center></h4><br>So friends, let us know what happens next and what is the true meaning behind it and what we do wrong because we do not have complete knowledge.<br>
        <br><li>Tulsi letter is placed in the mouth of the dead person, although today it is done for the sake of performing this ritual but no one knows the real reason behind it.<br>
            The real reason is that if a person dies from a serious illness, then after death the body starts releasing toxic micro-organisms, which can harm the people sitting around. Putting the Tulsi leaf on the tongue turns the leaf slightly black, if it turns black then to understand that toxic micro-organisms are coming out from the dead body, in such circumstances people should move away from the body.<br></li>
        <br><li>Half of the circumambulation is done after the last darshan of the dead person, we are currently circulating as much as we like, but in fact it is suggested to go around half of the circumambulation in our scriptures and that circumambulation can be done only by his son or daughter or wife of the deceased. <br>
            Starting from the left foot to the right foot and then touching the toe of the right foot is mentioned in the scriptures. But here we are all reversing.<br></li>
        <br><li>When the anonymity of a dead person comes out, he is given rest in a part of the village, although this is not seen in cities. But even today in the villages, anonymity is brought down to a part of the village and it is given rest.<br>
            Maharshi Kanad tells Rushi Shrusut that the creature sitting on Vatsa Madda sees the last part of his village. Then the four quince brought with anonymity is broken and broken on a stone. It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.<br>
            <br>
            But after a lot of hard work, we have come to know that the dead jivatma who is sitting on the corpse on the nanami at that time on the four dadhu who took away the anonymity, does not harm the four dadhu, that is why four shrifals are carried as a sacrifice to the jiva.<br>
            Because the soul does not like to leave the body, it wants to re-establish the body, in that endeavor the soul can harm the four dadhu. That is why he is offered four quinces, so that the creature cannot harm anyone.<br>
            </li>
        <br><li>The son or a relative who burns the dead body by putting it to sleep on anxiety, takes a pat on the shoulder and goes around vomiting. What is the reason for vomiting?<br>
            <br>
            So the reason is that after leaving the body, the creature travels in the opposite direction, like the human being, the squirrel does not move, so the mud fodder moves in the opposite direction in such a way that the edge of the water falls from it, so that the final tribute of water is given to the creature.<br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <br><li>The dead body is set on fire with the toes of the right foot, yes friends the fire is touched before the right foot of the dead body.<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Eye: - 31 minutes</li>
                <li>Brain: - 10 minutes</li>
                <li>Feet: - 4 hours</li>
                <li>Bone: - 30 days</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Friends, according to our ancestor Vidra, the skin survives for up to 5 hours.
        </li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>So the body of the deceased should not be cremated some time ago, not doing so is tantamount to burning it alive. When we are going to be killed, we are going to take a bone as big as a kuldima and throw it in the Ganges.<br>
<br>It is known from above how many mistakes we make, we bring two or four bones in a colander and leave the other bone in the graveyard and leave our parents wandering in the ghost vagina.<br>
<br>
<br>When the corpse is cremated, people stand in a circle around the fire, but Manu Bhagwan says that by taking the smoke of the corpse's cheetah, the life span of a person decreases. One asat is such that the smoke of twenty corpses reduces the life span of ten years by inhaling the smoke of cheetahThen on the tenth day to take off the hair, that is, to take off all the hair from the shoulder of the corpse, head, beard, mustache, etc. The germs that come out of the top may be in her hair. Even taking a bath does not destroy it, but at present, except for four Kandhiyas, the whole family is able to get down.<br>
<br>Now we have to talk about a special ritual, the ritual of filling the shaiya. We have a custom now that the shaiya that is filled behind the deceased is taken away by a Brahmin. But in fact, according to the rules made by the sages and sages, this shaiya, the daughter of the deceased who is married, is taken away, if the deceased has more than one daughter, all are equally distributed, and if the deceased has no daughter, no one from the family The scriptures have commanded that the daughter of the brothers should be given shaiya if she is married<br>
<br>On the day of Dash Maa, the ritual of liberating life is performed by donating pind. Friends, our scriptures say that the body of a ten-year-old child who donates, goes at the same speed, until it floats in the air at his home, in our society it is also seen that after a person dies. , Twelve are sent to distribute Shama Prasad to the temple.<br>
<br>
<br>We make the mistake here that three generations of Mutak have been asleep for ten days. So their food, water or anything else is forbidden, not even eggs, so these people understand, ten days someone<br>
<br>It is customary to gather the whole village on the day of the bar, but the scriptures say that only five Brahmins should eat the food in the bar. Because the father eats from the mouth of the Brahmin, the food reaches the dog from the mouth of the rest of the people. While eating food, Brahmins have to eat with mute mouth, if Brahmins talk while eating, fathers will keep going, then on the thirteenth day, uncle, aunt, uncle, aunt, uncle, uncle. Fawa Faiba etc. do not have to freeze relatives.<br>
<br>This is how friends perform the ritual, this ritual may vary according to religion or caste. Of which you all should take special note. We can also make a mistake, sorry if there is a mistake somewhere and friends please give feedback in the comment box about how you felt about this article.<br>
