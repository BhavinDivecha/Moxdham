                formally, the body of the deceased person can go to the next
                world without getting entangled in the underworld or the
                underworld. This reduces the likelihood that he (the ancestors)
                will cause trouble to the family, as well as that the penis will

                ><br />
                <br />After the death of a person, according to the scriptures,
                his actions are to be performed by a priest. In most places, it
                is difficult to find a priest who has knowledge of funerals.
                Here are some common steps you can take to begin the process of
                preparation for mediation. Some of these actions may have
                differences, as well as differences by province / tradition.
                Wherever such differences are found, seek the advice of your
                priests.<br />

                  indirectly (counterclockwise) by all four limbs (sides). Light

                  After the beheading of the corpse (after hearing the sound of

                  on his shoulder facing south at the feet of the deceased.
                  Anyone else should stand behind the doer and dig a hole under
                  the neck of the pot with a small stone in the cemetery (this
                  stone is called 'Ashma'). The doer should make the first
                  rotation around the leopard in a counter-clockwise direction
                  by pouring water from the pot. The second one should drill a
                  second hole under the first hole. After this, the doer should
                  make another round as before. After this, the second person
                  should make a third hole under the second hole. The doer

                  As sattvic and natural objects are used for worship, In the
                  same way, it is necessary to use sattvic objects while
                  lighting the cheetah!
                  <br />We use natural and sattvic ingredients like ghee, oil,
                  camphor in our worship. We eat fresh food without eating
                  stale, raw or spoiled food. Similarly, since the corpse is
                  also a samidha during cremation, it is inappropriate to use
                  unnatural and non-existent items like 'petrol', 'kerosene',
                  'diesel' and 'tire' while burning the cheetah. Also, these
                  items are air pollutants.<br />
                  Those who cannot afford to use sattvic and good quality items
                  should use low quality items, i.e. those who cannot use pure
                  ghee of native cow should use less vegetable ghee. For those
                  who cannot use sesame oil or good quality oil, use low quality
                  palm oil. The purpose of this formula is to explain that it is
                  inappropriate to use unnatural and unnatural objects to ignite
                  a cheetah during a funeral. Therefore, the use of these items
                  should be avoided.

              <br />The scriptures say that after death, the bodies of children
              (evidence) should be mined and the bodies of the elderly (adults)
              should be cremated. The formulas for the funeral of children and
              the scriptures about them are given below.<br />

              <ul class="ps-4">
                <li>
                  If the child dies before naming (up to 12th day) mining should
                  be done. (Physical evidence.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the death of a child up to 3 years of age with or
                  without a rite of passage, either burning or mining is done.
                  However, it is more appropriate to bury after death if it is
                  not completed after 2 years, whereas it is more suitable to be
                  cremated after death if it is completed after 2 years.

                  The gross body is related to the earth. A child of 2 years old
                  has a thick body. Therefore, it can easily mix with the gross
                  body (earth principle) in the soil (earth principle), that is,
                  the decomposition of the gross body into the five elements is
                  easy. As we age, the inertia of the gross and subtle bodies
                  increases. If the body is buried, it is difficult to
                  disintegrate in Panchatattva. After death, his body was
                  reduced to ashes by cremation. This ash mixes easily in the
                  soil, which means that the gross body is easily decomposed
                  into five elements.
